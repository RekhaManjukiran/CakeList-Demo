CakeList Demo Project


***
NOTE: No Third Party Libraries have been used. However, one may use AFNetworking (for Networking requirements), SDWebImage (for asynchronous image loading and caching)
***

 The app loads a JSON feed containing a repeated list of cakes, with title, image and description from a URL, then displays the contents of the feed in a scrollable list.

The original code has also been restructured, refactored and optimised where appropriate to use platform best practises.
